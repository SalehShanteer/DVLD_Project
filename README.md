# Driving & Vehicles License Management System

I'm excited to share my latest project: a comprehensive Driving & Vehicles License Management System designed to streamline and modernize the operations of the driving and vehicles license department. This robust Windows Forms application offers a suite of features to effectively manage people, users, and both local and international driversâ€™ licenses.

## Key Features:
- **User Management**: Efficiently manage user data, roles, and permissions.
- **License Management**: Handle applications for license detention, release, renewal, replacement for damage or loss.
- **Security**: Implemented user permissions and login records to ensure data safety and user accountability.

## Technical Highlights:
- **Technology Stack**: Built using C# .NET and MS SQL for a reliable and scalable solution.
- **Data Access**: Utilized ADO.NET for efficient database connectivity.
- **Architecture**: Designed with a 3-Tier Architecture to ensure separation of concerns, scalability, and maintainability.
- **T-SQL**: Leveraged T-SQL for database management, including stored procedures and complex queries.

While this project is not highly advanced, it effectively meets the needs of the department and demonstrates solid foundational skills in software development and database management.

I'm proud of the functionality and efficiency this system brings to license management, and I look forward to seeing its positive impact.
